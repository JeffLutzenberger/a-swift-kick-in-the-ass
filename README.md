# A Swift Kick in the Ass

### Abstract:
Join me on a whirlwind tour of Swift in a production environment. We’ll cover Swift’s design philosophy, its primitive types, functional programming features and its interoperability with Objective-C - all within the context of a production application. We'll conclude by taking a look at how we use Swift at Pulsara.
